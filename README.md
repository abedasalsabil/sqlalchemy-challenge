# sqlalchemy-challenge

Hello! This is my project on SQLAlchemy. My entire work is in the jupyter notebook file called "Notebook" in the folder called SurfsUp. Please refer to this notebook for grading. 

I would like to thank the guest instructor, Kristina, for navigating us through SQLAlchemy. It was very nice to meet her and to learn such important skills from her. 

Thank you!
