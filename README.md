# sqlalchemy-challenge

Hello! This is my project on SQLAlchemy. My jupyter notebook file called "Notebook" is in the folder called SurfsUp. As well, you can find my app routes in the app.py file in SurfsUp folder as well.

I would like to thank the guest instructor, Kristina, for navigating us through SQLAlchemy. It was very nice to meet her and to learn such important skills from her. 

Thank you!
